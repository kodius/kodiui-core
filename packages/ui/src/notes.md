Maybe we dont need to make a createContract(kodiContract, ...defSettings)

We can hardcode values inside kodiui and in the project override values like in root

:root {
--space-xl: new value.
}

just maybe..

think it will be ugly to see all vars being override in console

////

We have to make somehow BreadPoints dynamic
We have to be able to set new colors

like tailwind

module export somethign = {
  colors: {
    primary: "green"
  }
}
